# Implementation of a genetic algorithm in python

> This code was used for optimization class

This repository employes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve Travelling Salesperson problem (TSP).

Different types of selection, mutation and crossover can be imported from the _operators_ folder.

Usage:
1. Install requirements
2. Open _main.py_
3. The problem can be passed to it, or it can be generated at random
4. Run the main file

Grid search can be used to test a multitude of parameters.
